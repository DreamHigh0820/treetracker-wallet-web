# Treetracker Impact Wallet

## Development Environment Quick Start

1. Make sure all npm modules are installed for client.

```
npm i
```

2. Start the client

```
npm start
```

3. Open the web map in the browser with URL: http://localhost:3000

### How to Build Components

We recommend using Cypress's component tool to build components separately:

To run Cypress unit/component tests:

```
npm run cyu
```

To simulate mobile device in the component tool:

Because we focus on the mobile device, so when we build component by using Cypress component tool, we want to operate the component in the simulator of mobile device, with the devtools in Chrome, the most important feature is the swipe/touch simulator (you can see it when you open Chrome devtools and switch to any mobile device), but it becomes tricky if you are using the Cypress component took, cuz we have to use big screen to show Cypress dashboard, how can we open a big screen and simulate the mobile behavior at the same time, this video is a tutorial showing how to set it up:

### How to Build Pages/Routes

Glossary:

- Page/Route: every unique path of url on the app is a page or route, like a single tree page: `http://map.treetracker/trees/123`.

#### We need to build integration test for every page

We need to build Cypress integration test for every page/route, the integration tests would be run in CI when merge code and deploy to protect app from breaking.

Also, integration tests bring some benefits for the development workflow, by mocking API requests, we can separately develop every single page, if you'd like to practice Test Driven Develop, you can mock the API and write the tests first, then implement the real page later.

#### To run Cypress integration test

```
npm run cy
```

### How to mock the API

[Video tutorial for mock the API](https://www.loom.com/share/48554f0f67314ea78925a627b2142e1b)

## The API

We got another team working on the API endpoint, so the API spec is evolving. This is the current API specification:

[API spec](/doc/wallet-web-app.yaml)

To check the doc in a convenient way, please import it to some API tools like: http://editor.swagger.io/ or Postman.

### Using our mock API server

To develop without relying on the code of API team, we set up a mock API server for development.

The development mock API server is here: [mock server](https://4861b9cd-4ac3-460e-b42f-9b14ac00c403.mock.pstmn.io).

So you can call the API `/wallets/[name]` by: `https://4861b9cd-4ac3-460e-b42f-9b14ac00c403.mock.pstmn.io/wallets/[name]`.

### Config

The config to set the API server is an env variable:

```
REACT_APP_API_WALLET=https://4861b9cd-4ac3-460e-b42f-9b14ac00c403.mock.pstmn.io/
```

## Code style guide

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/), [Eslint](https://eslint.org/) along with [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/) to style our code.

### Prettier

Prettier reformats the code, but does not do code rule checking. If you are using VSCode as your IDE, please follow [this guide](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-format-code-with-prettier-in-visual-studio-code) to set up Prettier and automatically format your code on file save.

You can find the Prettier rules in the .prettierrc file.

### Eslint

To check the coding rules we use Eslint. To validate the rules manually, you must run:

```
npm run lint
```

To fix automatic rules run:

```
npm run lint:fix
```

In .eslintrc.js, there is a set of rules with status **off or warn**. Whenever you are developing a new file or an existing file try to correct some warnings, because in the future the rules will be activated.

Once the rules are activated, you can't make a commit until you fix the lint errors!

You can find the Eslint rules in the .eslintrc.js file.

### husky

With husky we can use any git hook. Git Hooks are actions that can be executed if a certain Git event occurs. For example when a developer makes a 'git commit' or a 'git push'.
To add a command to a pre-commit hook or create a new one, use:

```
npx husky add .husky/pre-commit "<your command>"
```

.husky folder contains all our hooks. E.g.:

```
npx pretty-quick --staged
```

The [pretty-quick](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pretty-quick) npm package runs Prettier on your changed files.

### Commit Message and PR Title Format

We use [commitlint](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/commitlint), to format out commit messages. Commitlint checks if your commit messages meet the conventional commit format.

You need to use a proper commit message format or you will not be able to commit your changes! husky checks your commit messages before every commit.

Your commit messages will need to follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format, for example:

```
feat: add new button
```

```
chore: run tests on travis ci
```

```
fix(server): send cors headers
```
